## Pandas Challenge
-----------------------------
In this Challenge we will demonstrate our knowledge of Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.


# PyCity Schools
----------------------
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# PyCity Schools Analysis
-------------------------

1) From the data analyzed we have found that charter schools have outperformed district schools in average test scores and overall pass rate. Charter schools in this district tend to have a smaller student population which tends to be advantageous when collecting an average. A follow up study on teaching practices and curriculum of district wide schools would be beneficial to draw a more conclusive analysis as to why charter schools have higher test scores and averages. 

2) Schools with higher spending ranges per student underperformed compared to schools with lower spending ranges per student. 

3) Comparing average math scores per grade we found that charter schools have also outperformed district schools. Again, charter schools in this district tend to have a smaller student population which tends to be advantageous when collecting an average. A follow up study on teaching practices and curriculum of district wide schools would be beneficial to draw a more conclusive analysis as to why charter schools have higher math scores per grade.
